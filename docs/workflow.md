# Workflow Steps

The right panel now follows a four-step flow:

1) Search location
2) Set frame
3) Lock frame
4) Compute simulated traffic

Advanced controls (tools, settings, topography, roads, and traffic options) remain available under the Advanced section for reference while the workflow evolves.
